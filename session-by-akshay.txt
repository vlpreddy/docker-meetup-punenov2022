#We need to use labels
#We need to define list user previlleges, we have to use that user to run out containers but not the root user.
  # Run addgroup -S myapp &the & adduser -S app-user -G myapp
#Use Copy Instead of ADD command

    #When we use Copy command to avoid any secuty issue
    #Don't leave sensitive information in docker images. User varaibles instead of direct vaues.
    #Adding the entire git repo
    #WE can use dockerignore file to make sure the files should not upload to docker image/
    #Should prefere multistage build
    #User static code analysisvs
    #Verify and sign images to mitigate MITM attacks
      it will help you to avoid downloading unautorized images
